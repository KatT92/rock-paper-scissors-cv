Rock paper scissors project using teachable machine and tensorflow

## Teachable-machine
I used https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/ to upload images of rocks, paper, scissors and nothing to train the model. The more images tha were added, and the more different images, the more accurate the model got.
